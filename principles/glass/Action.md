**System theory:** A glass of water is a composite system consisting of a rigid container (glass) and a fluid substance (water) in a gravitational field, whose existence depends on maintaining both the structural integrity of the container and the containment of the liquid within it.

**Price of Action:** The glass of water pays the price of Energy through continuous work against gravity to contain the water, thermal energy exchanges with the environment, and the management of surface tension and pressure differentials that maintain the system's functional boundaries.

1. **Liquid Containment Efficiency** — The glass performs its primary function by expending minimal energy to maintain the water's position against gravity, failing when structural compromises require additional energy to prevent leakage.
2. **Thermal Transfer Regulation** — The glass-water system regulates heat exchange with the environment at a rate that balances thermal equilibrium with functional temperature maintenance, failing when excessive thermal conductivity accelerates energy loss beyond usable parameters.
3. **Condensation Energy Balance** — The glass manages the energy exchange between water and environment by limiting condensation formation to rates that don't significantly alter the system's temperature or stability, failing when condensation accelerates heat transfer beyond functional limits.
4. **Evaporation Rate Control** — The system regulates water loss through evaporation by maintaining an energy-efficient boundary layer at the water's surface, failing when boundary disruptions accelerate evaporation beyond sustainable rates.
5. **Perturbation Recovery Efficiency** — The glass-water system returns to equilibrium after disturbance with minimal energy expenditure through dampened oscillations, failing when resonance amplifies rather than reduces motion energy.
6. **Capillary Action Limitation** — The system manages the energy cost of maintaining the water-glass boundary by limiting capillary action to an optimal level, failing when surface energy imbalances create excessive climbing forces.
7. **Pressure Equalization Maintenance** — The water surface maintains pressure equilibrium with the atmosphere through minimal energy expenditure, failing when disruptions require excessive energy to restore balance.
8. **Dissolution Energy Minimization** — The glass minimizes the energy cost of maintaining its structure by limiting the rate at which its material dissolves into the water, failing when dissolution accelerates beyond the energy-efficient threshold.
9. **Microcurrent Suppression** — The water maintains relative stillness by dampening internal microcurrents through viscous friction, failing when thermal or mechanical inputs generate currents that require excessive energy to stabilize.
10. **Light Transmission Efficiency** — The glass maintains transparency by efficiently transmitting light with minimal energy absorption or scattering, failing when contamination or degradation increases the energy cost of maintaining visual clarity.
