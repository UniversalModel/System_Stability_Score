**System theory:** The human heart is a muscular organ that functions as a biomechanical pump, maintaining circulation of blood throughout the body to enable oxygen and nutrient delivery while removing waste products, with its existence defined by its continuous rhythmic contractions and ability to adapt to changing physiological demands.

**Price of Form:** The human heart pays the price of Time through continuous cellular repair processes, protein turnover, valve remodeling, and managed inflammatory responses that maintain structural integrity despite billions of contractile cycles over a lifetime.

1. **Myocardial Integrity** — Cardiac muscle cells must maintain structural cohesion and intercellular connections through gap junctions and intercalated discs, as fragmentation leads to arrhythmias and contractile failure.
2. **Valve Competence** — Heart valves must maintain proper leaflet elasticity and coaptation to ensure unidirectional blood flow, as deterioration causes regurgitation or stenosis that compromises cardiac output.
3. **Chamber Proportionality** — The four cardiac chambers must preserve their relative dimensions and wall thicknesses appropriate to their functional loads, as disproportionate remodeling leads to inefficient pumping and eventual failure.
4. **Coronary Patency** — Coronary arteries must maintain open lumens with intact endothelium to ensure myocardial perfusion, as progressive narrowing leads to ischemia and infarction.
5. **Conduction System Continuity** — The electrical conduction pathways from sinoatrial node through the ventricles must maintain cellular integrity and connectivity, as disruption leads to blocks or aberrant impulse propagation.
6. **Endocardial Smoothness** — The inner lining of heart chambers must maintain a smooth, non-thrombogenic surface, as roughening or damage creates sites for thrombus formation and potential embolism.
7. **Pericardial Compliance** — The pericardial sac must maintain appropriate elasticity to allow cardiac filling while providing containment, as fibrosis or effusion restricts function and compromises output.
8. **Papillary Muscle Alignment** — Papillary muscles must maintain proper orientation and chordae tendineae tension to support valve function, as displacement leads to prolapse and regurgitation.
9. **Autonomic Receptor Density** — The heart must maintain appropriate distribution and sensitivity of sympathetic and parasympathetic receptors, as dysregulation leads to inappropriate rate responses and arrhythmias.
10. **Collagen-Elastin Balance** — Cardiac extracellular matrix must maintain optimal ratios of collagen and elastin for both strength and flexibility, as imbalance leads to either rigidity or aneurysmal dilation.
11. **Cardiomyocyte Renewal** — The heart must sustain limited but essential cardiomyocyte turnover and repair mechanisms, as complete cessation accelerates age-related functional decline and failure.
12. **Electrolyte Channel Integrity** — Ion channels in cardiac cell membranes must maintain structural and functional integrity for proper action potential generation, as degradation leads to conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias.
