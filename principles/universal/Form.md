# U-Code — 15 Principles of Existence (Rules of Structure)
# Each principle is evaluated 0.0–1.0 for the entity being assessed.

## What is Code?
Code governs **what the entity IS** — its Form, structure, rules of existence.
It answers: Is this entity well-defined, internally consistent, and structurally stable?

---

1. **Clarity of Identity** — The entity has a clear, unambiguous definition of what it is. It is not confused about its own nature or purpose.

2. **Internal Consistency** — The entity's rules, laws, or principles do not contradict each other. There is no internal logical conflict.

3. **Reproducibility** — The entity can replicate or maintain itself over time. Its structure is stable across repetition or scale.

4. **Boundary Integrity** — The entity has clear, enforceable boundaries. It knows what is inside and what is outside itself.

5. **Minimal Complexity** — The entity achieves its goals with the minimum necessary structural complexity. It avoids bureaucratic or systemic bloat.

6. **Adaptability of Form** — The entity can modify its structure in response to new information without losing its core identity.

7. **Hierarchy of Norms** — The entity has a clear, respected hierarchy of rules — higher-order principles override lower-order ones.

8. **Transparency of Rules** — The rules governing the entity are visible, knowable, and accessible to those subject to them.

9. **Anti-Fragility** — The entity does not merely survive disruption — it becomes stronger through challenge and stress.

10. **Error Correction Mechanism** — The entity has built-in processes to detect and correct its own structural failures.

11. **Non-Redundancy** — The entity does not maintain duplicate or contradictory structures. Redundancy, when present, is intentional and functional.

12. **Scalability of Structure** — The entity's structure works at multiple scales — from micro to macro — without breaking down.

13. **Definitional Precision** — Key terms and categories within the entity are defined with mathematical or logical precision, not vague language.

14. **Historical Coherence** — The entity's current structure is coherent with and accountable to its own history and founding principles.

15. **Structural Integrity Under Pressure** — When external stress is applied, the entity's core structure holds. It does not dissolve under adversity.
