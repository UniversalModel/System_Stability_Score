# U-Credo — 15 Principles of Meaning (Rules of Purpose)
# Each principle is evaluated 0.0–1.0 for the entity being assessed.

## What is Credo?
Credo governs **where the entity POSITIONS itself** — its relationship to meaning, values, and the world around it.
It answers: Does this entity know WHY it exists? Does it serve something beyond itself?

---

1. **Clarity of Purpose** — The entity has a clear, stated reason for existence. It knows what it is for, not just what it is.

2. **Value Alignment** — The entity's actions consistently reflect its stated values. There is no gap between what it says and what it does.

3. **Long-Term Vision** — The entity plans and acts for the long term, not only for immediate gain. It can articulate where it is going in 10–50 years.

4. **Contribution to the Whole** — The entity creates value for systems larger than itself — community, ecosystem, civilization, or knowledge.

5. **Philosophical Grounding** — The entity's purpose is rooted in a coherent worldview, not arbitrary preference or opportunism.

6. **Resistance to Corruption of Purpose** — When offered short-term gain that contradicts its purpose, the entity resists. Its mission is not for sale.

7. **Cultural Coherence** — The entity's internal culture (behavior, norms, stories) reinforces its stated purpose rather than contradicting it.

8. **Ethical Compass** — The entity applies consistent ethical reasoning across all its decisions, even when ethics is costly.

9. **Meaning for Members** — Individuals within the entity find personal meaning in their participation. They are motivated by mission, not only by reward.

10. **Relationship with Truth** — The entity pursues truth actively, even when truth is uncomfortable. It does not suppress inconvenient facts.

11. **Innovation as Service** — New capabilities and ideas within the entity are developed in service of its purpose, not as ends in themselves.

12. **Positive Narrative** — The entity tells a coherent, honest story about itself to the world. Its self-description matches reality.

13. **Sacrifice Capacity** — When purpose and profit conflict, the entity consistently chooses purpose. It can absorb losses for its mission.

14. **Intergenerational Thinking** — The entity's decisions account for the wellbeing of those who do not yet exist — future generations, future users, future citizens.

15. **Transcendent Motivation** — At its highest level, the entity acts from something beyond self-interest: beauty, truth, justice, or love of the discipline itself.
