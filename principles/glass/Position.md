**System theory:** A glass of water is a composite system consisting of a rigid container (glass) and a fluid substance (water) in a gravitational field, whose existence depends on maintaining both the structural integrity of the container and the containment of the liquid within it.

**Price of Position:** The glass of water pays the price of Space by requiring a stable, level surface with adequate friction and area to resist displacement forces, while also demanding sufficient clearance from disruptive environmental factors that could compromise its position.

---

1. **Base-Surface Contact Adequacy** — The glass maintains stability by distributing its weight across sufficient base-surface contact area relative to its height and contents, failing when this ratio falls below the tipping threshold.
2. **Center of Mass Alignment** — The filled glass maintains its position by keeping its center of mass vertically aligned above its base footprint, failing when displacement shifts this alignment beyond the base perimeter.
3. **Friction Coefficient Sufficiency** — The glass resists sliding by maintaining adequate friction between its base and the supporting surface, failing when the friction coefficient drops below the minimum threshold needed to counter lateral forces.
4. **Meniscus Boundary Adherence** — The water maintains its position within the glass by adhering to the container walls with sufficient force to create a meniscus, failing when contamination reduces this adhesion below the containment threshold.
5. **Vibration Damping Capacity** — The glass-water system absorbs environmental vibrations without toppling by converting kinetic energy to heat through internal friction, failing when resonant frequencies amplify rather than dampen oscillations.
6. **Capillary Rise Limitation** — The water maintains its bulk position by limiting capillary action to a height that doesn't allow escape over the rim, failing when surface properties change to increase capillary rise beyond this limit.
7. **Condensation Containment** — The glass maintains environmental boundaries by containing water condensation within a limited external surface area, failing when excessive condensation creates instability in its positioning context.
8. **Pressure Gradient Stability** — The water maintains its level position by equalizing to atmospheric pressure at its surface, failing when pressure differentials create flows that disrupt this equilibrium.
9. **Thermal Expansion Accommodation** — The glass-water system maintains its position by accommodating differential thermal expansion between container and contents without displacement, failing when expansion forces exceed the system's spatial tolerance.
10. **Gravitational Alignment Preservation** — The water's surface maintains perpendicularity to gravitational force regardless of minor container tilts, failing when tilt angles exceed the critical threshold where surface tension is overcome by gravitational pull.
