**System theory:** The human heart is a muscular organ that functions as a biomechanical pump, maintaining circulation of blood throughout the body to enable oxygen and nutrient delivery while removing waste products, with its existence defined by its continuous rhythmic contractions and ability to adapt to changing physiological demands.

**Price of Position:** The human heart pays the price of Space through constant resistance against gravitational forces, respiratory movements, postural changes, and hemodynamic pressures that would otherwise displace it from its optimal functional position within the thorax.

1. **Mediastinal Anchoring** — The heart must maintain its position within the mediastinum through vascular connections and pericardial attachments, as displacement compromises great vessel function and cardiac filling.
2. **Diaphragmatic Relationship** — The heart must maintain proper spatial relationship with the diaphragm to ensure optimal thoracic pressure dynamics, as altered positioning impairs venous return and cardiac output.
3. **Atrioventricular Alignment** — The atria and ventricles must maintain proper spatial alignment to ensure efficient blood transfer between chambers, as misalignment increases resistance and reduces stroke volume.
4. **Valvular Plane Stability** — The fibrous skeleton must maintain the geometric relationships between valve planes, as distortion alters valve function and chamber dynamics.
5. **Coronary Ostial Positioning** — Coronary artery origins must maintain proper positioning relative to the aortic valve cusps, as displacement can cause flow obstruction during systole.
6. **Pulmonary-Systemic Separation** — The interatrial and interventricular septa must maintain complete separation of pulmonary and systemic circulations, as defects cause shunting and oxygen saturation abnormalities.
7. **Great Vessel Orientation** — The aorta and pulmonary artery must maintain proper angular relationships to their respective ventricles, as torsion or kinking impedes outflow and increases afterload.
8. **Intercostal Relationship** — The heart must maintain appropriate positioning relative to the intercostal spaces, as displacement alters the effectiveness of external cardiac compression during resuscitation.
9. **Phrenic Nerve Clearance** — The heart must maintain sufficient distance from the phrenic nerves, as contact or compression leads to diaphragmatic dysfunction and respiratory compromise.
10. **Apex-Base Axis** — The heart must maintain its normal oblique orientation with the apex directed anteriorly, inferiorly, and to the left, as deviation alters mechanical efficiency and electrical axis.
11. **Pericardial Space Preservation** — The heart must maintain minimal but essential pericardial fluid for frictionless movement, as either excess or absence impairs contractile function.
12. **Thoracic Compliance Adaptation** — The heart must maintain positional adaptability to changes in thoracic compliance during respiration, as rigidity of position leads to respiratory-cardiac asynchrony.
