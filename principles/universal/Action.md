# U-Rights — 15 Principles of Dignity (Rules of Relationship)
# Each principle is evaluated 0.0–1.0 for the entity being assessed.

## What is Rights?
Rights governs **how the entity ACTS toward others** — its treatment of people, entities, and systems it interacts with.
It answers: Does this entity treat others with dignity? Does it respect the existence of others?

---

1. **Recognition of Other** — The entity genuinely recognizes the autonomy and existence of other entities. It does not treat others as mere instruments.

2. **Non-Exploitation** — The entity does not extract value from others in a way that degrades or destroys them. Its gains do not require others' losses.

3. **Accountability** — When the entity causes harm, it acknowledges this, takes responsibility, and works to repair the damage.

4. **Transparency to Stakeholders** — The entity communicates honestly and openly with those who are affected by its actions.

5. **Protection of the Vulnerable** — The entity actively protects those within or around it who are least able to protect themselves.

6. **Rule of Law Adherence** — The entity operates within agreed legal and social frameworks. It does not exempt itself from the rules it asks others to follow.

7. **Equitable Distribution** — The value the entity creates is shared with reasonable fairness among those who contributed to creating it.

8. **Voice for the Affected** — Those who are affected by the entity's decisions have a real mechanism to be heard and to influence those decisions.

9. **Non-Violence** — The entity resolves conflicts through dialogue, law, or negotiation — not through coercion, intimidation, or physical force.

10. **Environmental Stewardship** — The entity treats the natural environment as a stakeholder, not as a free resource to be consumed without consequence.

11. **Privacy Respect** — The entity does not invade, exploit, or weaponize the personal information of individuals it interacts with.

12. **Freedom of Exit** — Those within the entity's sphere of influence can leave voluntarily. The entity does not trap or coerce continued participation.

13. **Fairness of Process** — Decisions affecting others are made through processes that are fair, consistent, and free from arbitrary discrimination.

14. **Reciprocity** — The entity gives back to the systems that sustain it — communities, ecosystems, knowledge commons — in proportion to what it takes.

15. **Universal Applicability of Its Standards** — The entity applies the same ethical standards to itself that it applies to others. It does not maintain double standards.
