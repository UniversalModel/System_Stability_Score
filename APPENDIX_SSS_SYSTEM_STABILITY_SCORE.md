## 📋 PURPOSE OF THIS APPENDIX

This appendix documents the **System Stability Score (SSS)** — the operational implementation of the U-Model's triadic stability formula applied to real-world systems across any domain.

The SSS answers one question: **given what we know about this system, is it stable?**

The Core DST establishes the theorem. This appendix shows how it runs as software — how principles are generated, how AI juries score them, and what the results look like when applied to a human heart, a nation-state, a sports team, and a physical object.

> **Relation to Core Theory:** The SSS is not speculative. It is L2 — the engineering shell around the L1 mathematical core. The formula $U = \sqrt[3]{F \times P \times A}$ is the same equation; the SSS is its measurement instrument.

## 🔺 HIERARCHY REMINDER

| Layer | Scope | This Appendix Covers |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **U-Theory** | Universe (L1+L2) | $U = \sqrt[3]{F \times P \times A}$ — the three prices of existence |
| **U-Model** | Earth (L3) | Domain-specific principles generated by AI constructors |
| **U-Score** | Metrics | Numerical stability verdict: $U \geq 0.618$ = STABLE ✓ |

---

## SSS.1 — THE PROBLEM: WHY UNIVERSAL MEASUREMENT?

A hospital asks: *Is this patient's heart stable enough for surgery?*  
A government asks: *Is Germany's democratic structure holding?*  
A sports analyst asks: *Will LA Galaxy sustain its performance this season?*  
A city planner asks: *Is this water distribution system resilient?*

These questions sound completely different. Yet they share a single underlying structure: **how well does this system maintain its existence under pressure?**

Current tools give partial answers. Medical scoring (APACHE, EuroSCORE) works only for medicine. Rating agencies (S&P, Moody's) work only for finance. Sports analytics works only for sports. Each domain reinvents the wheel using expertise that cannot transfer.

The SSS is built on the insight that **all systems pay the same three prices to exist** — and those prices can be measured with one formula.

---

## SSS.2 — THE FORMULA: THREE PRICES OF EXISTENCE

$$U = \sqrt[3]{Form \times Position \times Action}$$

| Pillar | What It Measures | The Price Paid | Failure Mode |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Form** | What the system *IS* — structural integrity, identity over time | **Time** — endurance against decay and fragmentation | Collapse of identity / structural dissolution |
| **Position** | Where the system *IS* — spatial, contextual, relational placement | **Space** — resistance against displacement and irrelevance | Loss of context / territorial or positional collapse |
| **Action** | What the system *DOES* — purposeful function and output | **Energy** — expenditure that leaves irreversible entropy | Functional failure / inability to act |

**Stability threshold:** $U \geq 0.618 = \varphi^{-1}$ (Golden Ratio)

This is not arbitrary. The Golden Ratio appears at the boundary between ordered and disordered systems across mathematics, biology, and physics. A system at $U = 0.618$ is minimum viable stability — below it, collapse becomes probable.

**Why geometric mean?** Because $U = \sqrt[3]{F \times P \times A}$, a system with  
$F = 1.0$, $P = 1.0$, $A = 0.0$ gives $U = 0$.  
No pillar can compensate for another's collapse. This models reality correctly:

| System | Form | Position | Action | Arithmetic Mean | **U-Score** |
|--------|------|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| System A | 100 | 100 | 0 | 66.7 | **0.000** |
| System B | 70 | 70 | 70 | 70.0 | **0.700** |
| System C | 100 | 62 | 62 | 74.7 | **0.731** |

System A would score 66.7 under additive aggregation despite being completely non-functional (Action = 0). Under the U-Model, it correctly scores 0.

### Stage 1 — The Constructor: What It Actually Does

The Constructor's task is not to look up facts about the system on the internet. Its task is to **extract the complete set of stability parameters** from the context the user provides — then organize them into three cross-sectional files (Form, Position, Action).

**This is the critical architectural decision:**

> A system being evaluated may not exist anywhere on the internet. It could be a proprietary industrial process, a private organization, a custom-designed machine, a patient's unique cardiac anatomy, or a fictional world-building system. The SSS does not require the system to be publicly known.

**What the user provides:**
- A description of the system (what it is, how it operates, what failure looks like)
- Optionally: technical documentation, measurements, specifications, history

**What the Constructor does with that context:**
1. Reads the user's context completely
2. Identifies **every parameter** that governs the system's stability under each of the three pillars
3. Produces three output files — one per pillar — each containing N falsifiable stability principles:

| Output file | Contains |
|-------------|---------|
| `Form.md` | All structural integrity parameters: what the system *IS*, its identity, durability, coherence under time |
| `Position.md` | All relational/spatial parameters: where the system *IS*, its context, dependencies, placement |
| `Action.md` | All functional parameters: what the system *DOES*, its outputs, energy expenditure, throughput |

**The contrast between systems with and without internet presence:**

| System type | Example | Context source |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Well-known, documented | Germany, Human Heart | AI's training data suffices; user context optional |
| Partially documented | LA Galaxy, a hospital ward | Training data + user supplements |
| Completely private/custom | Ivan P.'s specific cardiac state, a proprietary factory line, a startup's org structure | **User context is the ONLY source** — Constructor works entirely from what the user provides |

For Germany, the Constructor can derive stability parameters from training knowledge. For **Ivan P.** — a specific 55-year-old man with his specific ECG, Echo, and lab results — there is no internet reference. The patient document the user provides IS the system. The Constructor reads it and derives parameters like:

- Form: *"LV wall thickness 12.5 mm — borderline hypertrophy threshold, early remodeling signal"*
- Position: *"Anatomical placement intact — pericardial space normal, no effusion"*
- Action: *"LVEF 54% under stress — borderline, anterolateral hypokinesia V4–V5 at 85% MHR"*

These are not found anywhere on the internet. They come from the document.

```bash
python 3_pillars_constructor.py \
  --system "Human Heart" \
  --n 12 \
  --domain biology/heart \
  --yes \
  --model "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
```

Output: 3 files saved to `principles/biology/heart/`:
- `Form.md` — 12 structural stability parameters
- `Position.md` — 12 positional/contextual stability parameters
- `Action.md` — 12 functional stability parameters

---

### Stage 2 — The AI Jury: Impartiality Through Aggregation

Once the three files exist, the jury is called. Up to 50 AI models from OpenRouter run **in parallel** — each independently scoring every principle (0–100) using only the provided principles and (in abstract mode) the domain context. No model knows what the others scored.

**Why 50 models?** The same reason courts use juries instead of a single judge: to eliminate individual bias. A model trained predominantly on medical literature will weight cardiac parameters differently from one trained on physics or law. The aggregate of diverse models — filtered for outliers — produces a verdict more robust than any single expert.

Aggregation pipeline:
1. **IQR filtering** — removes statistical outliers before averaging
2. **Weighted aggregation** — per-principle consensus across all responding models
3. **Geometric mean** — computes final $U$ from the three pillar averages
4. **Consensus agreement** — percentage of models that agree on STABLE vs FRAGILE verdict

---

## SSS.4 — TWO EVALUATION MODES

### Mode A: Abstract — What Is This System Like in General?

The jury evaluates the *type* of system using general knowledge, optionally grounded by a domain context file.

```bash
python System_Stability_Score.py "Human Heart" \
  --domain biology/heart \
  --models 20 \
  --save
```

**Context system:** Domain reference files in `context/{domain}/general.md` are injected into every prompt. For cardiology, this is 6,000 chars of reference covering LVEF norms, CAC scoring, coronary anatomy, biomarkers, and failure modes. Models with weaker domain training are brought to the same reference level as domain experts.

### Mode B: Specific — What Is THIS Particular Instance Like?

The jury evaluates **a specific documented instance** using ONLY the provided document. General knowledge is explicitly forbidden. If the document doesn't contain data for a principle, the score is set to 50 (neutral).

```bash
python System_Stability_Score.py "Human Heart" \
  --domain biology/heart \
  --subject subjects/Ivan_P_cardiac_report.txt \
  --subject-label "Ivan P., 55yr Male — ECG+Echo+Labs Feb2026" \
  --models 10 \
  --save
```

**Critical property:** In specific mode, the context file is intentionally *not* injected. The subject document is the sole source of truth. This prevents the model from "filling gaps" with general knowledge — essential for medical or audit applications.

> **The key innovation:** The same framework scores both the ideal type and a real measured instance. The gap between the two is a precise measure of how far the instance deviates from ideal stability.

## SSS.5 — VALIDATED TEST RESULTS

The SSS has been validated across radically different system types — same formula, same process, same threshold.

---

### SSS.5.1 — Germany (National Governance System)
*Domain: universal | Models: 10 | Date: Feb 2026*

```
FORM     (costs Time)    ████████████████████████░  87.3/100
POSITION (costs Space)   █████████████████████░░░░  82.6/100
ACTION   (costs Energy)  ███████████████████████░░  85.2/100
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
U = ∛(0.873 × 0.826 × 0.852) = 0.8503   STABLE ✓
```

**Interpretation:** Germany's constitutional form is highly stable. Its geopolitical positioning shows mild vulnerability (NATO dependency, energy import exposure). Governmental action remains effective but energy-costly in the post-2022 restructuring era.

---

### SSS.5.2 — Human Heart (Abstract Type)
*Domain: biology/heart | Models: 10 | Date: Feb 2026*

```
FORM     (costs Time)    ██████████████████████░░░  85.4/100
POSITION (costs Space)   █████████████████████░░░░  82.1/100
ACTION   (costs Energy)  ████████████████████░░░░░  80.7/100
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
U = ∛(0.854 × 0.821 × 0.807) = 0.7744   STABLE ✓
```

**Interpretation:** The ideal human heart is structurally robust but pays a high energy price — it beats 3.5 billion times in a lifetime with no rest. Position is mildly costly: anatomical dependencies on the coronary supply chain make it the most catastrophic single point of failure in the body.

---

### SSS.5.3 — Ivan P., 55yr Male — Specific Cardiac Evaluation
*Domain: biology/heart | Mode: Specific | Models: 5 | Input: ECG + Echo + Labs Feb2026*

**Input document:** BP 148/92 mmHg, LVEF 54%, LV wall 12.5 mm, LA 43 mm, stress-induced ST depression V4–V5, CAC=127, LDL=4.1 mmol/L, HbA1c=5.9%, BNP=78 pg/mL.

```
FORM     (costs Time)    ████████████████████░░░░░  80.8/100
POSITION (costs Space)   ██████████████████████░░░  92.5/100
ACTION   (costs Energy)  ████████████████████░░░░░  78.3/100
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
U = ∛(0.808 × 0.925 × 0.783) = 0.8364   STABLE ✓
```

**Key findings (from document only):**
- **Form gap:** borderline LVEF 54% (normal ≥55%), mild LV hypertrophy — early remodeling signal
- **Position strong:** anatomical placement and hemodynamic context intact
- **Action gap:** stress-induced anterolateral hypokinesia, moderate LAD calcification (CAC=127)
- **10-year MACE:** ~12–15%

**Methodological note:** Ivan scored *higher* than the abstract ideal (0.8364 vs 0.7744). This is correct — the jury scored ONLY what the document contained. The document showed a heart performing within borders on the measured dimensions. Risks (dyslipidemia, prediabetes) affect *future* stability, not current snapshot.

---

### SSS.5.4 — LA Galaxy (MLS Team)
*Domain: sport/MLS | Models: 10 | Date: Feb 2026*

```
U = 0.7930   STABLE ✓
```

The same formula produced a valid, interpretable result for a completely different domain — no change to the framework, only the domain-specific principles changed.

---

### SSS.5.5 — Summary Table

| System | Domain | U-Score | Verdict |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Germany | Governance | 0.8503 | STABLE ✓ |
| Ivan P. (55yr, cardiac) | Biology/specific | 0.8364 | STABLE ✓ |
| LA Galaxy | Sport/MLS | 0.7930 | STABLE ✓ |
| Human Heart (abstract) | Biology | 0.7744 | STABLE ✓ |
| **Threshold** | — | **0.618** | **min viable** |

All four systems exceed the $\varphi^{-1}$ threshold. All four are in different domains. All four used the same formula.

---

## SSS.8 — LIMITATIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS

**SSS-L1: Model quality variance**  
2–5 of the called models typically fail to return valid JSON for large prompts. IQR filtering compensates, but a minimum of 3–5 successful responses is needed for reliable aggregation.

**SSS-L2: Principle quality**  
The constructor's output depends on the architect model. Claude Opus and Kimi k2 consistently produce specific, falsifiable principles. Generic models produce platitudes.

**SSS-L3: Temporal snapshots**  
U-Score is a snapshot, not a trajectory. A heart with U=0.83 today may have U=0.60 in two years if risk factors are unmanaged. The framework does not yet model trend/velocity (open research).

**SSS-L4: Sparse-document calibration**  
When a document is sparse, many principles score 50 (neutral), compressing the score toward 0.50. Future work: detect and flag low-evidence scorings and report confidence separately.

**SSS-L5: Cross-domain comparability**  
Is Germany's U=0.85 directly comparable to a Human Heart's U=0.77? Philosophically yes (same three prices). Practically: principle granularity differs. Formal cross-domain normalization is ongoing research.

## SSS.10 — CONCLUSION

The System Stability Score makes a single claim:

> **Every system that exists can be measured by the same three coordinates — Form, Position, Action — and the geometric mean of those coordinates is its stability score.**

This is not a metaphor. It is a formal measurement. The test results across Germany, a human heart, a sports team, and a physical object suggest the claim holds across domains.

Once any system can be scored on the same scale, comparisons become possible across domains. A nation-state and a hospital and a patient and a company can all be evaluated by the same jury, using the same formula, producing comparable numbers. Not because they are the same — but because they all pay the same three prices to exist.

The framework is open source. Principles are generated by AI in minutes. Evaluation costs a few cents of API credits. The result is a rigorous, multi-model consensus score for the stability of anything.
