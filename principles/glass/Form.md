**System theory:** A glass of water is a composite system consisting of a rigid container (glass) and a fluid substance (water) in a gravitational field, whose existence depends on maintaining both the structural integrity of the container and the containment of the liquid within it.

**Price of Form:** The glass of water pays the price of Time through gradual evaporation of the water, microscopic degradation of the glass material, and potential contamination or mineral precipitation, all of which must be managed within acceptable rates to maintain the system's identity.

1. **Material Integrity Threshold** — The glass material maintains structural integrity by resisting micro-fractures over time, failing when accumulated stress exceeds the material's yield point.
2. **Water Evaporation Boundary** — The water maintains its liquid state by evaporating at a rate that doesn't deplete the volume below functional threshold within expected usage time, failing when evaporation accelerates beyond this limit.
3. **Thermal Expansion Tolerance** — The glass accommodates thermal expansion without cracking by maintaining temperature changes within its material's elastic range, failing when rapid temperature differentials exceed this range.
4. **Surface Tension Maintenance** — The water preserves its upper boundary through surface tension that resists deformation over time, failing when contaminants reduce this tension below the cohesion threshold.
5. **Rim Integrity Preservation** — The glass rim maintains a smooth, chip-free edge that supports proper function over repeated use, failing when accumulated micro-damage creates hazardous drinking conditions.
6. **Dissolution Rate Limitation** — The glass material resists dissolution into the water at a rate slow enough to maintain both structural integrity and water purity over time, failing when leaching accelerates beyond acceptable thresholds.
7. **Microbial Growth Constraint** — The water remains potable by limiting microbial growth rates below harmful thresholds during expected usage duration, failing when biological contamination accelerates beyond this limit.
8. **Oxidation Resistance Boundary** — The glass material maintains its transparency by resisting oxidation processes that would cloud its appearance over time, failing when cumulative oxidation exceeds the clarity threshold.
9. **Mineral Precipitation Control** — The water maintains its solution properties by keeping dissolved minerals from precipitating during its expected containment period, failing when precipitation rates exceed dissolution rates.
10. **Wall Thickness Preservation** — The glass maintains sufficient wall thickness over time to support its structural function despite micro-abrasions from cleaning and use, failing when cumulative material loss compromises structural integrity.
