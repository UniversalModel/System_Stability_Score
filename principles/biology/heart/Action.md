> **Action** = what the system DOES · stability costs ENERGY (expenditure — change leaves entropy)

**System theory:** The human heart is a muscular organ that functions as a biomechanical pump, maintaining circulation of blood throughout the body to enable oxygen and nutrient delivery while removing waste products, with its existence defined by its continuous rhythmic contractions and ability to adapt to changing physiological demands.

**Price of Action:** The human heart pays the price of Energy through unceasing ATP consumption for contractile protein cycling, ion pumping across membranes, electrical signal propagation, and cellular maintenance, requiring approximately 6 kg of ATP daily for continuous function.

1. **Rhythmic Contraction Sequence** — The heart must maintain coordinated atrial-ventricular contraction sequence with appropriate timing intervals, as dyssynergy wastes energy and reduces cardiac output.
2. **Stroke Volume Regulation** — The heart must adjust stroke volume through Frank-Starling mechanism in response to preload changes, as failure to adapt leads to output mismatch with venous return.
3. **Rate Responsiveness** — The heart must modulate its beating frequency in proportion to metabolic demands, as inappropriate rates cause either inadequate perfusion or unnecessary energy expenditure.
4. **Coronary Autoregulation** — The coronary circulation must maintain flow proportional to myocardial oxygen demand regardless of perfusion pressure variations, as dysregulation leads to ischemia or hyperemia.
5. **Diastolic Relaxation** — The ventricles must achieve complete relaxation during diastole to enable adequate filling, as incomplete relaxation increases filling pressures and reduces preload.
6. **Ejection Fraction Maintenance** — The ventricles must eject an appropriate percentage of end-diastolic volume with each contraction, as reduced ejection fraction increases residual volume and cardiac workload.
7. **Afterload Adaptation** — The heart must adjust contractile force to overcome varying arterial resistance, as inadequate adaptation leads to either insufficient output or excessive myocardial oxygen consumption.
8. **Pressure-Volume Efficiency** — The heart must maintain optimal pressure-volume relationships during the cardiac cycle, as inefficient loops increase energy expenditure per unit of blood ejected.
9. **Baroreceptor Integration** — The heart must respond appropriately to baroreceptor signals for blood pressure regulation, as insensitivity leads to inappropriate cardiac output for systemic needs.
10. **Metabolic Substrate Flexibility** — The myocardium must switch between fatty acid and glucose metabolism based on availability and demand, as inflexibility leads to energy production deficits during stress.
11. **Electromechanical Coupling** — The heart must maintain efficient conversion of electrical excitation to mechanical contraction through calcium handling, as uncoupling wastes electrical energy without mechanical output.
12. **Ischemic Preconditioning** — The heart must activate protective mechanisms during mild ischemia to prepare for potential severe ischemia, as failure of this adaptation increases vulnerability to infarction.
