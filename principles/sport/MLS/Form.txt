Personal Ethics for Players, Coaches, and Staff
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

No Shortcuts, No Excuses, No Quitting:
Play the game the right way. Own your mistakes. Never give up on a match or a teammate.

Team Before Ego:
Individual stats matter less than team success. Championships require sacrifice.

Continuous Improvement:
Work on your weaknesses every day. Study the game. Get better or get passed by.

Respect the Game:
Honor soccer's traditions. Play hard but fair. Respect opponents, referees, and the beautiful game.

Honesty with Coaches and Teammates:
Tell the truth about injuries and struggles. Hidden problems become bigger problems.

Accountability:
When you lose the ball, own it. When you win, share credit.

Preparation Over Talent:
Talent gets you signed. Preparation wins MLS Cups. Outwork your competition.

Mental Toughness:
34 games plus playoffs. Slumps happen. Stay focused. Control what you can control.

Support Your Teammates:
Celebrate others' success. Help struggling teammates. The locker room is a family.

Protect the Locker Room:
What happens in the locker room stays there. Trust is earned and easily broken.

No Drugs, No Cheating:
Play clean. PEDs destroy careers, teams, and legacies.

Respect for Authority:
Listen to coaches. Follow organizational rules.

Professionalism:
Be on time. Be prepared. Represent the club well on and off the pitch.

Community Responsibility:
You represent this city. Give back. Be a positive example.

Belief in the Process:
Trust the organization's plan. Development takes time. Stay patient, stay hungry.
