MLS ORGANIZATION CREDO
Organizational Culture and Standards
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Player Development First:
Building players is more important than buying players. Academy and MLS NEXT are our future.

Long-term Thinking:
Make decisions for 5 years, not 5 games. Championships are built through development.

Data-Informed Decisions:
Use analytics to inform decisions, but respect experience. Numbers tell part of the story.

Proximity to Problems:
Decision-makers must understand the game. Front office should spend time on the training ground.

Clear Communication:
Everyone knows the plan. From the owner to the last substitute - no surprises.

Meritocracy:
Play the best players. Promote the best performers. DP status does not guarantee minutes.

Accountability at Every Level:
Coaches, scouts, executives - everyone is evaluated. Results matter.

Adaptability:
The game changes. Rules change. Competition changes. We adapt faster than rivals.

Respect for All Roles:
Scouts, trainers, kit staff, analysts - every role matters. Treat everyone with respect.

Culture of Self-Evaluation:
Ask hard questions. Why did that signing fail? Learn and improve.

Collaboration Over Silos:
Analytics and scouts work together. Coaches and front office share information.

Invest in People:
Training and career development for players and staff. Better people make better clubs.

Protect Organizational Values:
New hires must fit the culture. Culture is non-negotiable.

Innovation:
Try new approaches. The clubs that innovate win.

Championship Mindset:
Everything we do is aimed at MLS Cup. Not making playoffs. Championships.
